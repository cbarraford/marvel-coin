# Marvel Coin

A cryptocurrency with two-factor auth on the protocol layer, as well as 
idiot proof features.

## Features

Marvel Coin implements *two-factor auth* on the protocol layer to ensure that
even if someone steals your private key(s), they cannot steal your funds. A
brief [white paper](https://github.com/CBarraford/2FA-Coin) can be read
explaining these implementation details.

*Human friendly* addresses Marvel Coin also enables the ability to send coin(s) to an email address
rather than a public key. This makes it easier for humans to verify they are
sending to the right person. This feature is optional, for private
transactions, new public keys can be generated on each transaction.

*Confirmation Codes* adds the ability for the receiver to get a one-time-use pin
which is required for the sender to enter to complete the transaction. This
ensures that you can confirm that the person you want is the one actually
getting the coin(s).

### Personal Note
While I (Chad Barraford) love cryptocurrencies, I certainly get nervous using
them. Despite taking every reasonable precaution to protect my wallet, there
is always that fear someone will take my coins. Worse yet, and probably more
likely, I will do something stupid and send my coins to the wrong address or
what have you. This coin addresses all the things about crypto that gives me
a personal heart attack every time i use it. haha.

### In Development
Marvel is in development and not considered to be "production ready".
